Urls are made out of protocol part and resource name part. Domains are, as you could assume, unique. You should visit domain provider (there are tons out there), and purchase one after searching your wanted domain pattern. When you access an website, actually 2 things happen 1) your agent(PC, mobile, tablet… whatever) ask for certain domain, 2)DNS responds to you with matching IP address. This means, even though what you see in the address bar in your browser is familiar http://www.something.com, this is just something that YOU see, not what browser actually visits. When we visit website, its always towards its IP, not the letters you see (domains). (add explanation later) in short: the web addresses you see and the actual thing that runs the website are COMPLETELY detached. They are just mapped by DNS. What is DNS then? This is also called name server. As its name suggests, it stores your domain and corresponding IP. There are many, many name servers out there, and they are hierarchical. Some name servers are named Root Servers, and they handle massive network of name servers. By forming networks and hierarchy, your website address query will travel through the network until it gets back the right IP address. So it makes sense if ALL the name servers that have your domain and host(the server that carries website contents - simple version of seeing it) dies, you won’t be able to access that website with web address.Also, if the IP address changes and web address does not match with that IP address anymore in the registered DNS, it won’t be accessible anymore. Things are easier if you think of the name of website and the contents container of the website as two separate thing.","categories":[{"name":"Network","slug":"Network","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Network/"}],"tags":[{"name":"DNS","slug":"DNS","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/DNS/"},{"name":"Domain","slug":"Domain","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Domain/"},{"name":"Network","slug":"Network","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Network/"},{"name":"Beginner","slug":"Beginner","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Beginner/"}]},{"title":"TIL to blog","slug":"TIL-to-blog","date":"2017-10-08T09:24:20.000Z","updated":"2017-10-08T09:32:41.074Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/10/08/TIL-to-blog/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2017/10/08/TIL-to-blog/","excerpt":"","text":"Moving from TIL repository to BlogSo I am moving away from TIL repository to a blog, where I can just store random thoughts and code snippets.I’ll still use Medium for a longer, polished articles but I thought Github Pages would be better for displaying my TIL contents. So far my TIL contents have been randomly stacked in the TIL repository, but I found this rather visually not appealing. I also found myself writing quite long texts when I explain some stuffs, so blog is probably a better space to do it.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"blog","slug":"blog","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/blog/"},{"name":"TIL","slug":"TIL","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/TIL/"}]}]}
