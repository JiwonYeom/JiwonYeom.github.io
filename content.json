Installing SymfonyThis is simple if you follow the official guide. But one thing to remember: symfony command might NOT work if you don’t turn off &amp; on your terminal. Mine didn’t. If your command doesn’t work, turn your terminal off &amp; on again. symfony new [projectName] Should be enough to create your new project. Do NOT forget to change your root in nginx.conf file (If you are doing this on a nginx web server). The consoleSymfony can be managed by its own console and its commands, such as running its server or checking status, etc. Useful commands12345//check routed url listphp bin/console debug:router//refresh cache php bin/console cache:clear --env=prod File Directory src-AppBundle contains Controller. Resources-views contains view files.Which are two main places where you might want to begin. Twig engineSymfony uses html twig engine for its view as long as I have seen. I skimmed through the configs, and it seems like different rendering engine can be chosen, but this is interesting for me. So far, PHP frameworks that I used had plain HTMLs as its view templates. RoutingRouting is quite different from that of CI or Drupal, which are frameworks that I am familiar with. It uses a sort of annotation, which looks like the following123/** * @Route(&quot;/happy/name&quot;) */ This defines url pattern. But I think the file name and controller / function names are correlated since I got many errors while trying to get this work, and it seemed like the file name and function names must be right.This might be a mistake, so I’ll try to update if it turns out differently. Unresolved Issues (trying to find out) I am having issues (or this might not be an issue) with cache. From the beginning, when I was trying to see if my page has changed after changing some parts in index.html.twig, it didn’t change.Newly added controller wasn’t recognized too, until I did this: php bin/console cache:clear –no-warmup –env=prod I’m not sure if this is something that I must do every time I do some changes. There might be some way, so I’ll keep on searching. DebuggingIt said debugging toolbar should show up, but I haven’t seen it yet :(I think I might have set up something wrong, and trying to figure this out.update!==&gt; I found this out. My website seems like it’s on a production mode instead of development mode. I accessed app_dev.php by explicitly using its url, and the bar showed up.I think this is because of my web server setting, which is not the built-in php server. I’ll have to check up a bit more. Dev &amp; ProdI think Symfony divides these two quite strictly. I’m still trying to find out the exact mechanism, but there are two files -app.php and app_dev.php. While I was setting up nginx.conf, it also separated these two environments, which is good. But I should take more in-depth look to see exact settings and usages. Memory issueWhile I was trying to install FOS\\rest-bundle, I encountered memory issue. Allocated memory exceeded, so I tried to increase the memory_limit parameter in php.ini file to 1G, but it didn’t work.I though there might be another issue, but today I tried it again by putting -1 as its value. As a result, the memory alert was gone but now I had allocation exception in Composer. This was solved after I entered few commands suggested here","categories":[{"name":"PHP","slug":"PHP","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/PHP/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Symfony","slug":"Symfony","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Symfony/"},{"name":"PHP","slug":"PHP","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/PHP/"},{"name":"Framework","slug":"Framework","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Framework/"}]},{"title":"BEM Introduction-2","slug":"bem-2","date":"2017-10-08T10:00:02.000Z","updated":"2017-10-08T10:11:44.506Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/10/08/bem-2/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2017/10/08/bem-2/","excerpt":"","text":"BEM - File Structure, naming conventions and CSS1.

Block Represented by CLASS attribute name describes its PURPOSE Component encapsulates behaviors, templates, styles, etc. Should NOT influence the environment. Do not set margin, padding, postion, etc. No CSS tag / ID selectors. Nested structure. Arbitrary placement : blocks should be able to move around the page without modifying CSS / JavaScript Reuse by creating instances 2. Element name describes its PURPOSE naming rule: block-name__element-name. NESTING : Even if they are nested, they are all part of a BLOCK, not an ELEMENT. (block-name_elment-name__element-name &lt;= not allowed). If this is needed (elements under element), use service block instead. MEMBERSHIP : element is ALWAYS a part of a block. Optional 3. Modifier Describes its APPEARANCE, STATE, and BEHAVIOR. Separated from block / element name by a single _. Cannot be used alone. Use it alongside block / element class Types: Boolean: when presence / absence of modifier is important &amp; value unimportant. Key-value: when modifier value is important. Defines appearance and behavior of a block / an element. optional Similar to HTML attr can change during runtime 4. BEM entity Blocks, elements, and modifiers 5.

Urls are made out of protocol part and resource name part. Domains are, as you could assume, unique. You should visit domain provider (there are tons out there), and purchase one after searching your wanted domain pattern. When you access an website, actually 2 things happen 1) your agent(PC, mobile, tablet… whatever) ask for certain domain, 2)DNS responds to you with matching IP address. This means, even though what you see in the address bar in your browser is familiar http://www.something.com, this is just something that YOU see, not what browser actually visits. When we visit website, its always towards its IP, not the letters you see (domains). (add explanation later) in short: the web addresses you see and the actual thing that runs the website are COMPLETELY detached. They are just mapped by DNS. What is DNS then? This is also called name server. As its name suggests, it stores your domain and corresponding IP. There are many, many name servers out there, and they are hierarchical. Some name servers are named Root Servers, and they handle massive network of name servers. By forming networks and hierarchy, your website address query will travel through the network until it gets back the right IP address. So it makes sense if ALL the name servers that have your domain and host(the server that carries website contents - simple version of seeing it) dies, you won’t be able to access that website with web address.Also, if the IP address changes and web address does not match with that IP address anymore in the registered DNS, it won’t be accessible anymore. Things are easier if you think of the name of website and the contents container of the website as two separate thing.","categories":[{"name":"Network","slug":"Network","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/Network/"}],"tags":[{"name":"DNS","slug":"DNS","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/DNS/"},{"name":"Domain","slug":"Domain","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Domain/"},{"name":"Network","slug":"Network","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Network/"},{"name":"Beginner","slug":"Beginner","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/Beginner/"}]},{"title":"TIL to blog","slug":"TIL-to-blog","date":"2017-10-08T09:24:20.000Z","updated":"2017-10-08T09:32:41.074Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/10/08/TIL-to-blog/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2017/10/08/TIL-to-blog/","excerpt":"","text":"Moving from TIL repository to BlogSo I am moving away from TIL repository to a blog, where I can just store random thoughts and code snippets.I’ll still use Medium for a longer, polished articles but I thought Github Pages would be better for displaying my TIL contents.
